Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent Systems: A Review of Challenges, Solutions and Applications


Introduction：
    require multiple agents to communicate and cooperate to solve complex tasks
    multi-agent training schemes
    multi-agent transfer learning
    trial and error (TE) procedure
    the mechanism of temporal-difffference (TD) learning 
    brought the theory of optimal control including Bellman equation and Markov decision process together with temporal-difffference learning to form
a well-known Q-learning
